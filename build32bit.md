I need to switch compilation to 32 bit mode

Assistant: 
To switch the compilation of your Go project to **32-bit mode**, you'll need to update your `GOARCH` environment variable to specify the 32-bit architecture. Here's how you can do it:

### Steps to Compile in 32-bit Mode

1. **Choose the Target Architecture**:  
   `GOARCH` determines the target architecture for your binary. For 32-bit systems, this is usually `386`.

2. **Set Environment Variables for Compilation**:  
   Use the following environment variables:
   - `GOARCH=386` (for 32-bit architecture)
   - Optionally, set `GOOS` to specify the target operating system, like `linux`, `windows`, or `darwin`.

3. **Update Build Command**:  
   Run the following command in your terminal to build for a 32-bit system:
   ```bash
   GOARCH=386 go build
   ```
   If you also need the build for a specific OS, include `GOOS`. For example:
   ```bash
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=386 go build
   ```

4. **Verify the Binary Output**:  
   Once compiled, check the binary with a tool like `file` (on Linux/macOS) to ensure it was compiled as a 32-bit binary:
   ```bash
   file your-binary-name
   ```

### For Cross-Compilation
If you're compiling on a different system but targeting 32-bit architecture, Go supports **cross-compilation** out of the box. Just specify the appropriate `GOOS` and `GOARCH` as shown above. Ensure any native libraries (if you're using SWIG and C/C++ code) are built for the correct target environment.

### Handling SWIG in 32-bit Compilation
Since your project incorporates C/C++ code through SWIG:
1. Ensure the compiler used for native C/C++ uses 32-bit mode. For GCC, you can use the `-m32` flag.
2. For example, set the `CGO_CFLAGS` and `CGO_LDFLAGS` for proper linking:
   ```bash
   export CGO_CFLAGS="-m32"
   export CGO_LDFLAGS="-m32"
   ```

3. Compile the project as:
   ```bash
   GOARCH=386 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build
   ```

### Notes:
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies (e.g., Fyne, SWIG, and any linked C/C++ libraries) support 32-bit compilation.
- **SWIG Configuration**: Check your SWIG configuration to verify it's generating stubs that are compatible with the 32-bit environment.

User: 
I need to compile C/C++ subroutines as 32 bit code, while the rest of golang program running on 64 bits 

Assistant: 
To compile the C/C++ subroutines as 32-bit code while keeping the rest of your Go program running as 64-bit, you need to mix architectures carefully. Here's the approach:

---

### Overview
- You will ensure the C/C++ code is compiled for 32-bit architecture using **CGO** and correct flags.
- Then, link the 32-bit compiled C/C++ code into your 64-bit Go program.
- This requires some care because Go itself runs as a 64-bit executable in this setup, but the C/C++ code will need to interop correctly in the 32-bit form.

---

### Key Steps

1. **Ensure System Compatibility**  
   - Ensure your system has the necessary 32-bit libraries and development tools installed (e.g., `gcc-multilib` for Linux).
   - Check that the toolchain you use supports both 32-bit and 64-bit builds.

---

2. **Compile C/C++ Code for 32-bit Architecture**  
   Use `-m32` with your C/C++ compiler to force a 32-bit build:
   ```bash
   gcc -m32 -o yourcode.o -c yourcode.c
   ```
   Or, for a C++ file:
   ```bash
   g++ -m32 -o yourcode.o -c yourcode.cpp
   ```

   - If your C code depends on external libraries, you may need their 32-bit versions installed on your system.
   - Ensure the output is a 32-bit object file by verifying it with `file yourcode.o`:
     ```bash
     file yourcode.o
     ```
     The output should indicate a `32-bit` object file.

---

3. **Set Go Environment to Use CGO**  
   Go’s `cgo` feature is used to integrate C/C++ into Go code. You need to set `CGO_ENABLED` and provide the correct `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` for 32-bit compilation.

   Set environment variables for compiling in mixed modes:
   ```bash
   export CGO_ENABLED=1
   export CGO_CFLAGS="-m32"
   export CGO_LDFLAGS="-m32"
   ```

---

4. **Link the 32-bit Object File in Go**  
   Use `cgo` directives in your Go code to reference the 32-bit C/C++ functions.

   Here’s an example:

   ```go
   package main

   /*
   #cgo CFLAGS: -m32
   #cgo LDFLAGS: -m32 -L. -lyourlib
   #include "yourheader.h"
   */
   import "C"

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       // Call a function from the C library
       result := C.your_function()
       fmt.Println("Result from C:", result)
   }
   ```

   - Replace `your_function` with a function signature from your C/C++ header file.
   - Include the right `.h` file in the **#include** statement.
   - Ensure `LDFLAGS` points to the directory containing your compiled 32-bit object or library.

---

5. **Build the Go Program as 64-bit**  
   Since the Go program itself remains 64-bit, set `GOARCH=amd64` and build as usual:
   ```bash
   go build -o yourprogram
   ```

   This links the 64-bit Go program with the 32-bit compiled C/C++ code. Thanks to `CGO`, Go will handle the interop automatically (assuming no pointers/data alignment issues).

---

### Key Pitfalls to Watch For

1. **Pointer Size Differences**  
   - Be careful when exchanging data (e.g., pointers, structs) between Go (64-bit) and C (32-bit). Alignment or pointer size mismatches can lead to crashes.
   - Use fixed-width types like `int32_t` and `int64_t` in C to maintain consistency.

2. **Machine Compatibility**  
   Ensure you are building for a platform that can work with mixed architectures. For instance, the host machine must be 64-bit with support for 32-bit compatibility.

3. **External Libraries**  
   If your C/C++ code relies on external libraries, you must have their 32-bit versions installed too.

4. **Dynamic Linking**  
   If you compile a 32-bit shared library (`.so` or `.dll`) instead of an object file, make sure it's locatable by the Go linker at runtime.

---

### Example

Let's assume you have a simple C file `add.c` with the following contents:
```c
// add.c
#include <stdint.h>

int32_t add(int32_t a, int32_t b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Compile it for 32-bit as:
```bash
gcc -m32 -o add.o -c add.c
ar rcs libadd.a add.o
```

The corresponding Go file for integration would look like:
```go
package main

/*
#cgo CFLAGS: -m32
#cgo LDFLAGS: -m32 -L. -ladd
#include "add.h"
*/
import "C"
import "fmt"

func main() {
    sum := C.add(10, 20)
    fmt.Println("Sum from C:", sum)
}
```

Compile and Run:
```bash
go build -o program
./program
```

The output should be:
```
Sum from C: 30
```

This ensures your C code is 32-bit, while the overall Go program remains 64-bit.
